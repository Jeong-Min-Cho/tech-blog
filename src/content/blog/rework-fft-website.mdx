## A New Job, A New Challenge

I recently joined Forefront Technologies as a developer. The interview process was excellent, and I've already met some fantastic people on the team.

However, as someone who cares deeply about web experiences, I can't help but notice that the current [Forefront website](https://www.fftechnologies.com/) could use some love.

This isn't a criticism of the company — it's an opportunity. Let me walk you through what I observed and what I plan to do about it.

## The Current State: A UX Audit

### Hero Section

*The current landing page hero section*

Right off the bat, there are several issues:

1. **Information overload** — Too much text competing for attention on the first fold
2. **Typography** — The font choices don't convey the modern, professional image the company deserves
3. **Background contrast** — The background video/image needs better contrast to make the text readable
4. **No clear value proposition** — A single, well-crafted sentence would be more impactful than multiple paragraphs

### Services Grid

*The services and solutions grid*

Moving down the page:

- **Outdated iconography** — The icons feel like they're from 2016, which doesn't match a company offering cutting-edge solutions
- **Dense information architecture** — Each card is overloaded with bullet points
- **Typography consistency** — The font styling feels inconsistent across different sections

### Feature Highlight

*The Docusign Documentum Connector section*

This section is actually relatively well-designed, but I have questions:

- **Imagery choice** — Why motherboards? The visual doesn't connect to document management
- **Weak hover states** — Hovering only changes the font color to black, which is minimal feedback for such prominent CTAs
- **Button hierarchy** — Both buttons have equal visual weight when one should clearly be primary

### Footer and Contact

*The footer and contact section*

The footer section has potential but needs work:

- **Typography** — The "Contact Us" heading uses an inconsistent font style
- **Hover states** — Again, interaction feedback is nearly invisible
- **Broken social links** — YouTube, email, and LinkedIn icons aren't actually linked to anything

### Dropdown Navigation

The dropdown menu reveals additional UX issues — overlapping content and unclear visual hierarchy.

## The Redesign Plan

I'm going to rebuild the Forefront Technologies website from scratch, focusing on modern web practices while keeping the brand intact.

### What I Will Do

| Area | Improvements |
|------|-------------|
| **Components** | Rebuild with modern, accessible React/Vue components |
| **Styles** | Clean typography, proper spacing, and visual hierarchy |
| **Performance** | Optimize for Core Web Vitals — blazingly fast load times |
| **SEO** | Proper meta tags, structured data, and semantic HTML |
| **Interactions** | Meaningful hover states and smooth transitions |
| **Accessibility** | WCAG compliance and keyboard navigation |

### What I Will Preserve

- ✓ The existing logo
- ✓ The blue color scheme and brand identity
- ✓ All current information and content
- ✓ The overall page structure and hierarchy

## Why This Matters

A company's website is often the first impression potential clients have. Forefront Technologies offers enterprise-grade document management solutions — the website should reflect that level of professionalism and attention to detail.

This project is about aligning the digital presence with the quality of the actual services provided.
